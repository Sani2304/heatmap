# Supply Chain Analytics: Correlation Matrix Visualization

This repository demonstrates a supply chain analytics workflow using Excel to generate a **correlation matrix** and a corresponding **heatmap visualization** for supplier performance metrics.

## Files in this repository
- **README.md**: Documentation of the task and steps
- **correlation.csv**: Exported correlation matrix from Excel
- **heatmap.png**: Visualization of correlation matrix using Excel conditional formatting

## Business Context
A manufacturing company aims to analyze supplier performance across critical supply chain metrics to make data-driven decisions.  
Metrics included:
- Supplier Lead Time
- Inventory Levels
- Order Frequency
- Delivery Performance
- Cost Per Unit

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Import dataset into Excel and use **Data Analysis ToolPak → Correlation** to generate the correlation matrix.  
2. Copy the correlation matrix to a new sheet and apply conditional formatting:  
   - Select the correlation values (exclude labels).  
   - Apply **Color Scale** → **Red-White-Green** palette (Red = Low correlation, Green = High correlation).  
3. Export the correlation matrix as **correlation.csv**.  
4. Take a screenshot of the formatted heatmap (resize between 400×400 and 512×512 pixels).  
5. Validate repository contains all required files.
